# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors now with a graphical user interface.

## Features

The user can click on any of three buttons allowing them to play a match against the computer.

#### Roadmap:

- Add animations
- Add hotkeys so no mouse is required
- Add simple AI so opponents choices aren't completely random

## How to use?
